You can clone the repository and run it locally.  Once you have cloned it, just run

    npm install
    
Then     
    
    npm start
    
This will start a local server that can be reached at http://localhost:3000.  To test with this local copy, you must use
a different client id.  This can be done by appending the client id to the URL - for example:

    http://localhost:3000?clientId=5VB5EJFS79PRJ
